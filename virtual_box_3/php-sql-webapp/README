Hi!

1. run populate.sql in MySQL to populate the database with relevent data.

2. Edit PROTO2URLPAGE.php and DETAILS.php to include your mySQL credentials.

3. OPEN PROTO2START on the the same server as the MySQL database.

You can search for the different spatulas within the webpage by attribute. 
Submitting leads to a results page which matches the details input by the user.
